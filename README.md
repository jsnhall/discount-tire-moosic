# Discount Tire - Moosic

[https://jsnhall.github.io/discount-tire-moosic/](https://jsnhall.github.io/discount-tire-moosic/)

All working dev files can be found in the [`/src`](https://github.com/jsnhall/discount-tire-moosic/tree/master/src) directory.

## Build Process
### Wireframe
I started off by drawing a wireframe which included a hero/masthead, new music, tour dates, merchandise, and contact section.
### Design
Once the wireframe was complete, I designed the page using an atomic design approach in Figma.

### Development
Development consisted of multiple steps:
* Environment setup
* Transferred assets (images, music, etc...)
* Developed responsive layout
* Made cards and music player functional
* Testing

## Thank you!
